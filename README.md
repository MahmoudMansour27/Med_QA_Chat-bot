 ***Medical Chatbot App***

## Overview

This project develops a Medical Question Answering Chatbot using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning technologies. The chatbot aims to provide accurate and empathetic responses to health-related queries, including:

- Understanding symptoms and suggesting potential causes.

- Explaining treatments, medications, and medical terminologies.

- Offering quick access to reliable healthcare information.

By leveraging medical-specific datasets and advanced NLP models, the chatbot bridges the gap between complex medical knowledge and users seeking reliable information. It is an intelligent tool designed to improve healthcare accessibility and user experience.

## Features

- **Custom NLP Pipeline**: Preprocessing of medical text using tokenization, stopword removal, and padding.

- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks for understanding user queries and generating context-aware responses.

- **Dataset Integration**: Uses medical-specific datasets to enhance response accuracy.

- **User-Friendly Design**: Designed to provide empathetic and meaningful responses to users' questions.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handles cleaning and preparing text data for training.

2. **Model Building**: Implements a deep learning model (Transformer-based) for understanding queries and generating responses.

3. **Evaluation**: Measures model performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss.

4. **Chatbot Interface**: A framework for interacting with users.
